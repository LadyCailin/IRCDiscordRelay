This is the code that runs the Discord/IRC bot for the official MethodScript channels.
It bridges the IRC and Discord, plus provides some bot functionality, 100% written in
MethodScript! Requires the CHDiscord and CHIRC extensions.

To run, use `mscript irc-discord-bridge.ms`, and create a profile with id="discord"
in profiles.xml
